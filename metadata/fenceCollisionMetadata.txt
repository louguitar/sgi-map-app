SGI fence collision risk metadata

Raster values
-------------
Numerical values from 0 to 3, representing fence collision risk. Values can be
categorized as follows:

0 to 0.49: low risk
0.50 to 0.99: moderate risk
1.0+: high risk

Coordinate reference system
---------------------------
Fence collision risk data have a WGS 84 geographic coordinate reference system.
Pixel resolution is approximately 30 m.

Data description
----------------
The fence collision risk data is produced by the Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI)
fence collision risk tool of the SGI interactive web application
(http://map.sagegrouseinitiative.com/). It is dependent upon user provided data
and produces a raster GeoTiff representing sage grouse fence collision risk
relative to lek locations or other areas of high bird concentration. Risk is
calculated as described in Stevens et al. (2013). User provided points represent
lek locations; fence collision risk is calculated relative to distance from the
lek, up to a maximum three km. Polygons represent areas of bird concentration,
e.g., wintering grounds. Fence collision risk is calculated the same as points,
except that distance is removed; everything within the polygon is treated as a
distance of zero.
